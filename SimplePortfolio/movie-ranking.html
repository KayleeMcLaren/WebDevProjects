    <h2>My top 3 movies of all time:</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>The Aristocats (1970)</h3>
    <p>The story is simple but engaging with a positive message. The animation is beautiful and expressive and the music is catchy and memorable.
        The characters are all likable and relatable, their interactions are often funny and heartwarming.</p>
    <h3>Anchors Aweigh (1945)</h3>
    <p>It's a feel good movie with a great cast - Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra, and Kathryn Grayson. The production values are top-notch. 
        The film was shot in Technicolor, and the visuals are stunning with excellent music and dancing.</p>
    <h3>Hello Dolly! (1969)</h3>
    <p>The score by Jerry Herman is one of the best in musical theater history - the songs are catchy, well-written, and perfectly suited to 
        the characters and story. The performances are top-notch with Barbra Streisand in her element as Dolly Levi. The direction by Gene Kelly 
        is energetic and stylish.
