// This code creates a simple Express API for managing posts. The API has four endpoints:

//posts: GET all posts, POST a new post
//posts/:id: GET a specific post by ID, PATCH a specific post by ID, DELETE a specific post by ID
//The API uses an in-memory data store to store the posts. This is not ideal for production use, but it is sufficient for a simple example.
